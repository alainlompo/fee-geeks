<h3>A note on merchant and the GetBalance function</h3>   
<a href='https://github.com/paypal/merchant-sdk-java'>The merchant sdk</a> seems to be in end of life since its github announces that it is no more actively supported and will be deprecated in the future. It's an information worth noting
and a lot of people will have to update their calls to use the new <a href='https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-Java-SDK'>REST API</a> 

The services are operational. Here is an illustration of the GetBalance tets<br/>
